# A simple Cloudflare Worker with built-in routing

Here's a simple CloudFlare Worker with a built-in router that allows you segment your worker logic into different functions and/or "controllers" so you can build something more powerful and with clean separation of concerns while working within the 1 script limit for non-Enterprise plans.

Sample route definitions:

    router.get('/cloudflare', SampleController.index);
    router.post('/cloudflare', SampleController.store);
    router.get('/cloudflare/:id', SampleController.show);
    router.put('/cloudflare/:id', SampleController.update);
    router.delete('/cloudflare/:id', SampleController.destroy);
    router.get('/cloudflare/routes/:id', (req) => {
        return response('Response from closure instead of controller: id=' + req.params.id);
    });

- src/index.js is your main CloudFlare Worker entrypoint. Update the routes in the file and point to your functions / controller.
- src/sample-controller.js contains an example of a basic controller
- src/router.js contains the basic router (feedback welcome)
- src/helpers.js contains some simple response/redirect helper functions
- src/http-method.js is just a simple enum for HTTP verbs.

## Quick Start

1. Rename `example.cloudflare.env` to `cloudflare.env` and edit the values as needed.
2. Update the **index.js** file with your routes, use function closures or separate controller files and go to town with a simple CloudFlare Worker with built-in routing!
3. Install deps with `npm install`
4. Launch ðŸš€ with `npm run deploy`
